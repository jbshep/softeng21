# Assignment 4

You will work in [project teams](../teams.md) for this assignment.

*One* developer in your team will begin by *forking* the project [https://github.com/jbshep/softeng21-a4](https://github.com/jbshep/softeng21-a4).

Then, do the following.

* Update the `README.md` file to answer the two questions listed therein.

* Create tests to test the code.  Try to cover all of the code with your
  tests.

You do not need to add code to your fork using issues/PRs/branches.  For this assignment only, you may commit and push directly to `main`.

You may add collaborators to your fork, or you may just have one developer (the owner of the fork) commit all the changes.

If your tests reveal errors in the code, you are *not* required to fix the code.  In other words, it is okay if your tests fail when you run them as long as the tests themselves are correct.  If you want to fix errors in the code, you are allowed to but again, it is not required.
