# Reading Assignment Links

This is a 300-level course.  Given the advanced nature of this course, students will engage more advanced, scholarly material and *reflect* on the topic of software engineering from the perspective of a computer science scholar.  Deadlines for reading the listed material below are given in the course syllabus, which is found both [here](../syllabus/softeng-syl-F21.pdf) and on Canvas.
