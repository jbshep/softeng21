# Final Presentation Grading rubric


| &nbsp;    | Exemplary	| Proficient |	Marginal 	| Unacceptable |
| ----- |-----| -----| ----- | ----- |
| Discussion of most technically challenging feature (M1 - M5) | **2 points**<br>Discusses design and coding of feature.  Shows relevant parts of UML.  Shows relevant parts of code (which may include unit test code).  Discusses error handling, edge cases, and testing. Discussion appears polished and prepared as opposed to improvised and ad hoc. | **1.5 points**<br>Deviation from "Exemplary" description in terms of abbreviated coverage of UML, testing, or error handling. | **1 point**<br>Lacks polish or preparation in more than one area.  Parts of "Exemplary" description receive only abbreviated attention. | **0 points**<br>Does not meet "Marginal" criteria. |
| Discussion of chosen feature group (M6) | **3 points**<br>Explains rationale for choosing the feature group.  Discusses design and coding of feature.  Shows relevant parts of UML.  Shows relevant parts of code (which may include unit test code).  Discusses error handling, edge cases, and testing. Discussion appears polished and prepared as opposed to improvised and ad hoc. | **2.5 points**<br>Deviation from "Exemplary" description in terms of abbreviated coverage of UML, testing, or error handling. | **2 points**<br>Lacks polish or preparation in more than one area.  Parts of "Exemplary" description receive only abbreviated attention. | **0 points**<br>Does not meet "Marginal" criteria. |
| Demo of software (with audience interaction) | **2 points**<br>Demo appears well planned as opposed to improvised. Demo shows basic uses cases and then edge cases if audience does not suggest them. | **1.5 points**<br>Deviation from "Exemplary" consists of minor interruptions to flow of demo. | **1 point**<br>Demo appears inadequately planned at one or more points. | **0 points**<br>Does not meet "Marginal" criteria. |
| Lessons learned | **3 points**<br>Identifies at least one lesson learned or valuable experience from the class and offers thoughtful reflection on how this lesson could affect future software engineering project experiences. Alternatively, explains why aspects of the class detracted from learning and prevented learning opportunities one would hope for. | **2.5 points**<br>Deviation from "Exemplary" lies in lack of concreteness in expressing how lesson learned could affect future software engineering project experiences.  Alternatively, fails to express concreteness in how aspects of the class detracted from learning. | **2 points**<br>Articulation of lessons learned are brief and not reflective. | **0 points**<br>Does not meet "Marginal" criteria. |

\*\* Note: grade of any one person may be reduced below the rest of the team's grade based on individual presentation performance.


Requirements for the <strong>oral presentation</strong>:

* The presentation will be 10 - 20 minutes.  All students in the team must have a significant speaking role.
* Talk about the most technically challenging feature to implement *prior to* Milestone 6.
* Talk about which feature group you chose to implement in Milestone 6, why you chose it, and what design and coding changes were needed to implement it.
* Demo your software.
* Invite suggestions from the audience on how to crash your software.
* Lessons learned: how has the experience in this class changed how you will build software in the future?
