# CMSC 360 Software Engineering (Fall 2021)

The course schedule and all deadlines are found in the course syllabus.  The syllabus can be found both [here](syllabus/softeng-syl-F21.pdf) and on [Canvas](https://bvu.instructure.com/).

Notifications of needed changes to the schedule will be posted on [Slack](https://bvcompsci.slack.com/) to the channel `softeng21`.  This course will *not* utilize the Canvas calendar.

The instructor's typical weekly schedule can be found online [here](https://jbshep.github.io/schedule/), however the instructor's actual schedule can be found through Outlook.  You should strongly consider making an appointment if you wish to meet with your instructor.  This can be done either through Outlook or through the new EAB app.
